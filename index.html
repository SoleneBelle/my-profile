		<h1>  Hello, I am Solene  </h1>


		<img class=" profile-picture "src="images/myprofile-picture.png">


		<p>I am 22 years old. I was born in Frejus on 20 September 1999. I am currently a student in <strong>M1 PGE at Kedge Business Schools</strong>. I am in the <strong>Operational Management</strong> major, which prepares us for all jobs related to the supply chain. For example, we have courses on the purchasing function and the fundamentals of the supply chain. For me, it was important to know more about the buyer's job. Indeed, at the end of this PGE I would like to become an <strong>international buyer</strong>.

		<h2> Why the buyer's profession? </h2>

	<p> During a professional experience and the notions learned within the two years of IUT I had a real infatuation for the sector of the negotiation. So I looked for a job that could be related to negotiation and I came across the job of buyer. Moreover, I had the chance to discuss with a buyer from Danone. This exchange reinforced my idea of working as a buyer.
